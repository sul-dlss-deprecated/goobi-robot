Robot-Suite-Base
---------

This is a baseline robot project using the new multiplexing framework, which builds upon `resque` for job-management. The idea is that if you're creating a new robot suite, you would fork this repo as a starting point.

Example robots are found in `robots/myDemo/*.rb`

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/sul-dlss/robot-suite-base/wiki) for further details.
